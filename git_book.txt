->Git: Git is a Version Control System.
->VCS:  Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions laterrr.
->Working Directory: A folder which comprises of files where we works to push/pull/clone its files to remote Repository(GitHub).
->Advantage of pushing files to remote repository is, when our system fails or crashed, we can extract them to our folders of file Manager.
->Remote repository: The repositories we create in GitHub are called remote repositories.
->Local/git Repository: The repository which is created on executing command (git init) in working directory.
     ->.git file is created in working directory when we do git commit.
     ->.git file is called local/git repository.
->Local repository contains staging area, first we add files to staging area by using command(git add filename).
->if we want to add all files of working directory use command(git add .)
->working directory----add--->staging area---commit-->local repository----push---->Remote repository(GitHub).
->The files in working directory which we add into staging area are called tracked files and rest are untracked.
->The files in staging area need to be committed to local repo and that can be done by using command(git commit -m "message").
->once we use commit command all files in staging area will move to local repo.
->After committing files in local repo can be pushed to remote repo after specifying to which remote repo need to push files.
      ->command: git remote add origin remoteRepoLink.
      ->Then push by using command: git push -u origin master.
      ->git log is to know modifications that we done.
      ->git branch -a is to know no.of branches in remote repo.
->Branch: We can create multiple branches where we can push files by specifically.
      ->A default branch is called Master branch.
